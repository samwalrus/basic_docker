To creat a new docker image a good strat is to start with:

docker run -it --entrypoint "/bin/bash" ubuntu:20.04

This will start an interactive ubuntu basic docker.

You can then install what you need and make a note of how you do it.

You then change the notes into your docker file

For Heroku, install and signup.(https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime)

Then naviage to a dir and run

heroku create

heroku container:push web (you may need to do -a and the app name)

heroku container:release web

heroku open
